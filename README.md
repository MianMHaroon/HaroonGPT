# HaroonGPT
HaroonGPT is a personal AI assistant I created to help users explore information about me and my work. It allows users to interact via a Streamlit chat interface, answering questions using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline built on embeddings, vector search with Qdrant, and large language models.
